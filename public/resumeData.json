    "bio":"First and foremost, I love, and I enjoy writing code. Ever since my first time learning C in high school, I fell in love with the feeling every time the compile ran successfully. Since then, it is always not enough with coding. For me, coding is technically a problem-solving skill that I have to get through the problems, solve it, and make it run. That's why I love it. This passion carried me through my education. When I had an exciting coding project, I can code for hours and hours without checking the time or checking on my social media until I finished the project.",
